            <ul>
                <li>Built-in admin interface, ORM, and a comprehensive set of tools and libraries.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Structure and Modularity</h2>
            <h3>NestJS Structure:</h3>
            <p>NestJS has a Modular structure that promotes separation and enhances maintainability. Each module contains specific functionality and communicates through well-defined interfaces.</p>
            <p>It is best practice to structure your application into clear, single-responsibility modules to keep your codebase clean and manageable.</p>
            <h3>Express.js Structure:</h3>
            <p>Express.js is flexible and un-opinionated, allowing developers to structure applications in various ways. It requires additional effort to maintain a clean architecture.</p>
            <p>For Express.js best practices, implement custom conventions and organizational patterns to manage complexity as your application grows.</p>
            <h3>Spring Boot Structure:</h3>
            <p>Here we have a modular architecture with a strong emphasis on dependency injection and annotation-based design. With support to add non-blocking and microservice architectures.</p>
            <p>Best practices in Spring Boot encourages using Spring’s dependency injection and component management features to create well-organized and maintainable codebases.</p>
            <h3>Django Structure:</h3>
            <p>Django has a monolithic architecture with a focus on the “Django way” of development. It provides a structured approach with built-in features for common tasks.</p>
            <p>It is best to leverage Django’s built-in components and follow its conventions to quickly build and maintain applications.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Performance and Scalability</h2>
            <p>NestJS is designed with performance in mind, supporting asynchronous operations and leveraging TypeScript for better performance and type safety.</p>
            <p>Its Modular architecture enhances scalability by allowing developers to scale individual components independently.</p>
            <p>Best Practices: Implement asynchronous processing and leverage NestJS strategies to optimize performance and scalability.</p>
            <p>Express.js is known for its fast performance due to its minimalist design. It is well-suited for lightweight, I/O-intensive applications. Scalability can be challenging in more complex projects. Depending on the project requirements, custom solutions may be needed for larger and enterprise-level applications.</p>
            <p>Best Practices: Leverage Node.js features like clustering and load balancing to scale Express.js applications.</p>
            <p>Spring Boot has excellent performance and scalability, with support for microservices and distributed systems. It leverages the JVM's capabilities for optimized performance.</p>
            <p>Best Practices: Use Spring Boot’s built-in features for monitoring and implementing system optimization for performance and scalability.</p>
            <p>Django has good performance for typical web applications but may face challenges with very high traffic due to its monolithic nature. Scaling with Django can be complex for high-traffic applications that require careful architecture and optimization.</p>
            <p>Best Practices: Implement caching and database optimization strategies to improve performance and scalability.</p>
